## QAT experiments

This space is meant for QAT experiments and exploration.

- model_nvqat.py - This is a sample code to use `quant_nn.Conv2d` node and to show how the quantized model can be exported.
  - This experiment was done on `pytorch 1.9` and depends on `pytorch_quantization` package found [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/tools/pytorch-quantization)
